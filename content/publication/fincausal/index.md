abstract: 'The paper describes the work that the team submitted to FinCausal 2020 Shared Task. This work
is associated with the first sub-task of identifying causality in sentences. The various models
used in the experiments tried to obtain a latent space representation for each of the sentences.
Linear regression was performed on these representations to classify whether the sentence is
causal or not. The experiments have shown BERT (Large) performed the best, giving a F1 score
of 0.958, in the task of detecting the causality of sentences in financial texts and reports. The class
imbalance was dealt with a modified loss function to give a better metric score for the evaluation.'
