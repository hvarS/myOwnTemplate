I am a [](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/dr-diptesh-kanojia)Backend Server Technology developer at [Oracle Cloud Applications](https://www.oracle.com/in/applications/). At Oracle , I work at developing efficient and robust solutions and automations for data pipeline for HCM and CX modules .

Apart from my job , I am frequently involved in research activities and I usually  address problems that intersect the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine or Deep Learning (ML/DL) which have impact for Social or Human Behavior Systems. 

I am currently involved in research works revolving around about graphical applications in computational conversational and social systems. I am currently involved in research activities with Prof. [Aruna Tiwari](https://iiti.ac.in/people/~artiwari/) on graphical ML techniques and Prof. [Tanmay Basu](https://sites.google.com/view/tanmaybasu/) on knowledge discovery in social setting. In the past , I had the pleasure to work with Prof. [Parimal Parag](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~parimal/) and Prof. [Vikram Srinivasan](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/people/vikram-srinivasan/) on understanding and characterising latency versus redundancy trade-offs in distributed systems.
