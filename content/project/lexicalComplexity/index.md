title: "Lexical Complexity Prediction"
summary: "Lexical complexity plays a crucial role in reading comprehension. Predicting lexical complexity accurately can enable a system to better guide a user to an appropriate text, or tailor a text to their needs. NLP systems have been developed to simplify texts for second language learners, native speakers with low literacy levels, and people with reading disabilities. Each potential word is assigned a judgment by a system to determine if it was deemed ‘complex’ or not.

The occurrence of an unknown word in a sentence can adversely affect its comprehension by readers. Either they give up, misinterpret, or plough on without understanding. A committed reader may take the time to look up a word and expand their
vocabulary, but even in this case they must leave the text, undermining their concentration.
