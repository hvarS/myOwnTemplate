title: "Lexical Complexity Prediction"
summary: "Lexical complexity plays a crucial role in reading comprehension. Predicting lexical complexity accurately can enable a system to better guide a user to an appropriate text, or tailor a text to their needs. NLP systems have been developed to simplify texts for second language learners, native speakers with low literacy levels, and people with reading disabilities. Each potential word is assigned a judgment by a system to determine if it was deemed ‘complex’ or not. "
