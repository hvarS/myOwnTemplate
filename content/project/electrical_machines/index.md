title: "Shunt Active Power Filter Design"
summary: "Due to the advancements in the semiconductor technology, the usage of power electronics devices
at the end user side is increasing day-by-day. A large amount of harmonic current gets injected
into distribution system due to this increasing usage of nonlinear loads and power electronic devices
like electric arc welders, switching power supplies and speed drives. Harmonic currents lead to
numerous issues in distribution systems like higher power losses, electronic equipment operational
failures, voltage distortion."
