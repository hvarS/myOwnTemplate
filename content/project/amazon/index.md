title: "Amazon User Privacy Analysis"
summary: "User reviews on Amazon play an integral role in decision
making for potential buyers on Amazon. However, while
writing reviews, users end up revealing sensitive information.
For example, users tend to mention their email IDs in the
case of poor service to be contacted by the seller. Besides,
product reviews naturally correlate with the money spent
by a user on a product. Aggregation of this data over time
can reveal substantial economic information about a user.
To that end, this vision paper discusses potential scenarios
of sensitive data leakage in accumulated Amazon reviews.
We conclude with thoroughly discussing potential future
research directs that can help mitigate privacy threat posed
by accumulated public amazon reviews."

Amazon accumulates user reviews in public user profiles: Specifically, Amazon marketplace encourages the buyers to rate their products and write qualitative reviews to describe their experience. There are several incentives for a user to write such reviews. First, users write reviews on e-commerce sites hoping that it would help others understand what to expect from the product [14]. Second, some users write reviews to gain the appreciation of other users.Third, some users write them for self-validation. The last two reasons are perhaps also acknowledged by Amazon.
