title: "Ensuring Individual Fairness with Pairwise Fair Representations"
summary: "In this project, we re-implement and enhance an oper-
ationalization of individual fairness that does not rely on a
human specification of a distance metric. Instead, we pro-
pose novel approaches to elicit and leverage side-information
on equally deserving individuals to counter subordination
between social groups. We model this knowledge as a fair-
ness graph, and learn a unified Pairwise Fair Representation
(PFR) of the data that captures both data-driven similar-
ity between individuals and the pairwise side-information in
fairness graph"
