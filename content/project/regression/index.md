title: "Modeling the profitability of Indian States with MLR"
summary: "In India states earn revenue through own taxes, central taxes, non-taxes and central grants. For most states, own taxes form the largest part of the total state revenue. Taxes as per the state list includes land revenue, taxes on agricultural income, electricity duty, luxury tax, entertainment tax and stamp duty. We model this information with a regression model which achieves great accuracy for variety of state performance indicators."

The analysis is focused on the factors affecting the profitability of the manufacturing sector across states. From the data, it can be seen that in the year 2017-18, Himachal Pradesh had the highest profitability of 18.44% while Maharashtra had the highest profit of Rs.1, 21, 35,683 lakhs. Similarly A&N Island had the lowest profit and profitability of -0.67%. The difference in the results can be widely
seen because of the difference in the amount of fixed capital, employment, the net value produced, and market share in terms of factories. The estimated model is precise enough to make predictions on the performance of the manufacturing sector through changes in capital intensity, vertical integration, labor intensity, and the number of factories present in a particular state.
